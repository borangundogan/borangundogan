## AI Researcher & Engineer

I’m a community-driven AI researcher and MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at **FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg**.  
I focus on developing end-to-end AI systems, from experimenting with new models to deploying practical solutions. My work combines research and implementation, where I explore emerging methods in machine learning and continuously test their potential in real-world applications. I’m especially interested in transforming complex ideas into scalable systems that can simplify workflows, improve efficiency, and open new possibilities for how we use AI in everyday life.
